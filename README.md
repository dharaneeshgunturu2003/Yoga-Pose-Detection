# Yoga Pose Detection using Deep Learning


## Overview
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can detect yoga poses based on input images. The model is trained on a custom dataset of yoga poses and can accurately classify different yoga postures.

## Features
- **Pose Detection**: Given an input image, the model can predict the yoga pose being performed.
- **Custom Dataset**: The model is trained on a custom dataset of yoga poses, ensuring accurate classification.
- **Easy to Use**: Detailed instructions on how to use the model for inference are provided below.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
   cd your_repo
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained weights for the model (if available) and place them in the `weights/` directory.

4. Run the inference script on your input image:
   ```bash
   python predict_pose.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```
