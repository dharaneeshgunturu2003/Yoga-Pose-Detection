# Yoga-Pose-Detection

I'd be happy to help you with writing a README file for your Yoga pose detection deep learning model on GitHub! A good README file is crucial for helping others understand your project and how to use it effectively. Here's a template you can use to get started:

Yoga Pose Detection using Deep Learning

Overview
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can detect yoga poses based on input images. The model is trained on a custom dataset of yoga poses and can accurately classify different yoga postures.

Features
Pose Detection: Given an input image, the model can predict the yoga pose being performed.
Custom Dataset: The model is trained on a custom dataset of yoga poses, ensuring accurate classification.
Easy to Use: Detailed instructions on how to use the model for inference are provided below.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
cd your_repo
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained weights for the model (if available) and place them in the weights/ directory.
Run the inference script on your input image:
bash
Copy code
python predict_pose.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
Model Architecture
Describe the architecture of your deep learning model here, including any pre-processing steps, the network architecture, and post-processing steps.

Training
If you have information on how the model was trained, including details about the dataset, training parameters, and performance metrics, include it here.

Results
Showcase some example results of the model's predictions on test images along with ground truth annotations (if available).
